# Smart Gesture-Based Interaction System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project enables **gesture-based control** for smart devices and virtual input mechanisms using **Mediapipe, OpenCV, and IoT**. It provides a touchless experience for interacting with digital systems, making it ideal for smart homes, AR/VR, and automation.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Virtual Input** â€“ Gesture-based keyboard and calculator.
- **IoT Control** â€“ Manage smart devices using hand gestures.
- **Real-Time Processing** â€“ Optimized for low latency and high accuracy.
- **Multi-User Support** â€“ Handles multiple gestures simultaneously.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Mediapipe** (for hand tracking)
- **OpenCV** (for computer vision processing)
- **IoT Integration** (Arduino)


## ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements
- AI-based adaptive learning for personalized gestures.
- Expanded IoT support for more smart home devices.
